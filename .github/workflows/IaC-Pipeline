# This workflow is developed as part of the PGDIP 2023-24 group 1 assignment
# Important Note: the apply step is configured to run only after the plan step completes successfully, 
# and specifically when there is a push to the master branch (which typically occurs after a pull request is merged). 
# This is controlled by the needs and if conditions in the apply job of this workflow file.
